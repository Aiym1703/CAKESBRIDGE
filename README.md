# Assignment 4 – Smart City Scheduling

## Algorithms Implemented:
- SCC: Tarjan’s algorithm 
- Condensation Graph: components compressed into a DAG. Parallel edges collapsed by min weight.
- Topological Sort: Kahn’s algorithm.
- Shortest Paths on DAG: dynamic programming over topological order from a source component.
- Critical Path :max-DP over topological order

- Graphs 1–3: Small to medium graphs, some containing small cycles or tri-components. 
- Graphs 4–6: Fully acyclic DAGs with moderate density. 
- Graphs 7–9: Larger DAGs up to 40 nodes and 46 edges, demonstrating scalability of the algorithms. 
- Iplemented graphs by using EXCEL. All datasets used edge-weighted models to evaluate shortest and longest paths across components


## Main report is report4.pdf,
Used Excel to create the tables and lectures to understand the topic.
